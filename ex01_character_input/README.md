# Exercise 01: Character Input
## Description:
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.

#### Extra:
1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message. (*Hint:[order of operations](http://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html) exists in Python*)
2. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. (*Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button*)
